# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is intended to help the new, incoming student better understand the topics they are about to be facing. Coming into the first week of this class was really difficult and surprisingly overwhelming. I VERY nearly quit after every class the first week. This, in part, is due to my lack of understanding of what coding actually entailed initially. I have already learned the basic structures of webpages and design work. Understanding the basics before going into class really helps make the class manageable. Sticking with this idea of investing in understanding the building blocks of each different type of language ensures the pacing of class becomes less of a obstacle.

## Usage

This should be used to self teach some important terms and ideas prior to or after classes in order to solidify the ideas in your mind. These topics include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If the DevTools console is opened, JavaScript should be verified running. A loop is run to select from the list of the terms which topic to study. Consider using this study guide, and the ideas within it, to create your own template of problematic terminology.
